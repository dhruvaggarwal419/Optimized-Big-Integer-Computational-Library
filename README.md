# Optimized-Big-Integer-Computational-Library

Overview

The Optimized Big Integer Computational Library is a high-performance, robust C++ library designed to handle operations involving large integers beyond the limits of standard data types. This library provides optimized algorithms for arithmetic operations, comparisons, and other utilities while ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

Features

Support for large integers: Handles integers larger than the limits of built-in types like int and long.

Efficient Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Comparison Operations: Equality, greater than, less than, etc.

Utility Functions: Modular arithmetic, GCD calculation, power operations, etc.

Performance Optimizations: Implementations are optimized for computational speed and reduced memory usage.

Use Cases

Cryptography and security algorithms.

Mathematical and scientific computations.

Competitive programming scenarios.

Applications requiring high-precision calculations.

Installation

Prerequisites

A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

C++17 or later is recommended for compatibility.

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/dhruvaggarwal419/Optimized-Big-Integer-Computational-Library.git
cd Optimized-Big-Integer-Computational-Library

Build the Library

Use a C++ compiler to compile the source code. Example:

g++ -std=c++17 -o big_integer main.cpp

Usage

Integration into Your Project

Include the BigInteger.h file in your project.

Compile your project with the library source files.

Example

Here's an example demonstrating how to use the library:

#include "BigInteger.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    BigInteger a = "123456789123456789123456789";
    BigInteger b = "987654321987654321987654321";

    // Addition
    BigInteger sum = a + b;
    std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;

    // Multiplication
    BigInteger product = a * b;
    std::cout << "Product: " << product << std::endl;

    // Division
    BigInteger quotient = b / a;
    std::cout << "Quotient: " << quotient << std::endl;

    // Comparison
    if (a < b) {
        std::cout << "a is less than b" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

Outputs

Sum: 1111111111111111111111111110

Product: 1219326313565005315910684315815966601475246086230625

Quotient: 8
